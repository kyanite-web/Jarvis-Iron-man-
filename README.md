# Jarvis - Your Personal AI Assistant

So basically, I'm building my own version of Jarvis from Iron Man. You know, the sassy AI that talks to Tony Stark and actually gets what he's saying? Yeah, that.

## What's This About?

This project is all about creating a voice assistant that doesn't make you talk like a robot. You can chat with it casually, throw in some slang, and it'll still understand what you want. Plus, it's got some fun Easter eggs (like preparing the goon chair - if you know, you know).

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Talk to it like you would to a friend. No need for those stiff "Hey Google" phrases.
- **Informal Language Support**: Slang? Abbreviations? Casual speech? It gets it.
- **Voice Recognition**: Because typing is so 2010.
- **Custom Commands**: Teach it new tricks as you go.
- **Goon Chair Mode**: Special feature for the real ones. (Prepare the goon chair, and all that.)

## What I'm Building With

*This section will be updated as I add more code and dependencies.*

The goal is to keep this lightweight and modular. I'm thinking:
- Python for the backend logic
- Speech recognition libraries (probably `speech_recognition` or something similar)
- Some NLP magic for understanding context
- Maybe a GUI later? We'll see how ambitious I'm feeling.

## Installation

*Coming soon as I finalize the code!*

For now, the repo is mostly planning and setup. But when it's ready, you'll be able to:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the main script
4. Start talking to your new AI overlord

## Usage

*Also coming soon!*

The idea is to make this super simple to use. Just run it, say what you need, and Jarvis handles it. Whether that's setting reminders, controlling smart home devices, or just having a conversation.

## Roadmap

Here's what I'm planning to tackle:

- [ ] Core voice recognition functionality
- [ ] Natural language understanding
- [ ] Response generation system
- [ ] Command execution framework
- [ ] Integration with various APIs (weather, news, etc.)
- [ ] Smart home device control (if I can get my hands on some)
- [ ] The infamous goon chair preparation sequence
- [ ] Maybe a holographic interface? (Just kidding... unless?)

## Contributing

If you want to jump in and help build this thing, that'd be awesome! Just:
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch for your feature
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

I'm open to ideas, bug fixes, and especially improvements to make Jarvis even smarter.

## Why Though?

Because why not? Everyone's out here asking Alexa for the weather when we could have something way cooler. Plus, this is a great way to learn about AI, speech processing, and how to make technology that actually feels human.

## License

MIT License - See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

Basically, do whatever you want with this. Build your own Jarvis, improve it, make it better than mine. Just don't sue me if it becomes sentient.
